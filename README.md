# Welcome to the Raspberry Pi IoT Workshop

IoT workshop based on a Raspberry Pi with a DHT22

# Real World IoT with the Raspberry Pi

## Stream Environmental Conditions to Watson IoT and Analyse IoT Sensor data

Learn how to connect a Raspberry Pi to Watson IoT over MQTT and stream environmental data from the sensors to the IBM Cloud.  Workshop attendees will learn about Node-RED programming on the Raspberry Pi and IBM Cloud, MQTT, and Watson IoT Platform.

Follow the links to access the different sections of the course:

### [Part 1](/part1/README.md)

Provides an overview to the course, introduces the hardware and the Node-RED programming environment.  It gets you programming the Raspberry Pi device to be able to access and control the hardware.
Part 1 finishes with an overview of the IBM Cloud, the cloud platform used in this workshop and ensures you have a working cloud account with the required resources.

### [Part 2](/part2/README.md)

The second part of the workshop looks at the Internet of Things service on the IBM Cloud and how you connect a device to the IBM Cloud using the MQTT protocol.  

### [Part 3](/part3/README.md)

In this section we look at using Node-RED on the IBM Cloud to implement the server side part of the IoT solution.  You will create a dashboard to visualise the IoT data.  

We've provided all the links used throughout the workshop as well as links to other resources [**here**](/RESOURCES.md) to help you explore a little more about IoT.
